# neovim-setup

My personal neovim setup.

To compile Neovim from source, run the following commands:

```bash
cd neovim-setup
bash compile_neovim.sh
```

To install the packages, run the following commands:

```bash
cd neovim-setup
bash install.sh 
```

Then, open neovim and run `:Copilot setup` to complete the Copilot installation. Copy the generated token and paste it to https://github.com/login/device.
